# Air_quality_app_v2
Web application with Vue frontend and FastAPI (Python) backend.

It monitors air quality and pollution in every place in the world thanks to **Airly API**.

It has main dashboard, in a detailed view you can see information as charts and forecast data.

And standard factor specified for air pollution for current location.

Check air tab and Workout scheduler is on going...
Workout scheduler - hit the 'cleanest' timeslot for the outdoor workout ( it you are a sport freak like me
it might be quite usefull :)).
